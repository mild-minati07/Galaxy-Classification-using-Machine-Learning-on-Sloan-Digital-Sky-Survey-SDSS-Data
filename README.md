# Galaxy-Classification-using-Machine-Learning-on-Sloan-Digital-Sky-Survey-SDSS-Data
This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) dataset. Using photometric features and image data, models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and CNN are applied to achieve accurate and automated galaxy classification.
